# Production Planning Dashboard Using VBA and Excel

## Overview
The main objective of assignment 3 is to create a forecast automatically of the 3 variables: demand, production cost, and holding cost.  
With this, there are two-time series forecasting methods for each variable: one with a trend with four-quarter seasonality and another with a trend of 12-month seasonality.  

The goal is to select the best forecasting method for each variable based on the mean squared forecast error. Then the future values will be calculated and inserted in the data sheet, along with a button added in the main sheet for "Generate Forecasts."

### **Part 2**

This part 2 aims to expand the business analytics system developed in part 1. The main objective is to generate a Metric Measurement Report in PDF format. The report will include details such as total cost, production cost, inventory cost, and production schedule. Additionally, generating line charts that show the historical and the forecasted values for production unit/demand and Inventory levels. There will also be a “generate report” button created with a message box that will display the saved PDF file’s name and directory.
