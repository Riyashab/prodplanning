# Production Planning Dashboard Using VBA and Excel

Overview:
The main objective of assignment 3 is to create a
forecast automatically of the 3 variables, demand, production cost, and holding cost.
With this, there are two-time series forecasting methods for each variable: one with a
trend with four-quarter seasonality and another with a trend of 12-month seasonality.
The goal is to select the best forecasting method for each variable based on the mean
squared forecast error and then the future values will be calculated and inserted in the
data sheet along with a button added in the main sheet for “generate forecasts.
